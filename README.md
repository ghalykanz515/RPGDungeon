Project Title
2D RPG Dungeon Game With Web3 System

Description:
In this project, we are making a 2D RPG Dungeon Game, which we also add with the Web3 system.
In this project we use the Unity Engine to make the game and use the ThirdWeb, Third Web is an SDKs in every language, smart contracts, tools, and infrastructure for web3 development,
and one of them also a part for Unity Engine and we use it to make it easier to create a Web3 system in the game.
The player must fight many enemies in several rooms in the dungeon then a coin will come out and the player has to collect it,
when the game is over the player will be asked if the coin will be used as a token to be put into the metamask wallet.

WARNING!
The Fully game with the web3 system it's on the branch-1
